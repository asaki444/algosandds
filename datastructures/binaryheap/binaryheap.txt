MAX BINARY HEAP => parent nodes are always larger than the children

MIN BINARY HEAP => parent nodes are always smaller than the chidl nodes

each parent has at max two children

as compact as possible 

every left and right are filled before 

Priority Queue 
    >> commonly used data structures
    >> Queue, als assign priority(importance level to each item)


REPRESENTING A HEAP 
=======
for any index of an array n...

Find a child based off of a parent
---------
left child = 2n + 1;
right child = 2n + 2;

Find a parent node
----------
(n - 1)/2 floored to find its parent

Adding to a MaxBinaryHeap
=========================

Add to the end of the heap, and bubble up

swap until it respects the heap rules
